<h2>📖 Core Questions of Investment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The essence of investment is <strong>giving up consumption today → getting more returns in the future</strong>.</li>
    <li>Successful investment = finding quality companies that can <strong>generate cash flow in the long term</strong>.</li>
    <li>Failed investment = chasing hot spots, speculating on concepts, and eventually stock prices return to value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 Theory of Value Investing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Value Investing</strong> was first proposed by Benjamin Graham, who is known as the "Father of Security Analysis".
        <ul>
            <li>Core theory:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Company = Business</strong>, buying stocks is equivalent to buying part of the business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Price vs Value</strong>: Market prices fluctuate daily, but the long-term value of companies is relatively stable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Margin of Safety</strong>: Only when the price is far below the value is it worth buying.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Buffett improved on Graham's foundation:
        <ul>
            <li>Not only buy at low prices, but also buy "good companies" → deep moats, strong cash flow, and long-term growth.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    📌 Summary: Value investing is not about chasing short-term ups and downs, but about selecting companies that "can continue to make money" and holding them for the long term.
</blockquote>

<h2>📈 Returns from Long-term Holding of Quality Companies</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>S&P 500</strong> → Average annualized return of <strong>8–10%</strong> over the past 100 years.</li>
    <li>If you start investing $10,000 at age 20 and retire at 65:
        <ul>
            <li>Annualized <strong>10%</strong> → Final amount exceeds <strong>$1,000,000</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Buffett Case</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>From 1965–2022, Berkshire Hathaway's annualized return was <strong>19.8%</strong>, far exceeding the S&P.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Individual Stock Example</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Buying Apple stock for $10,000 in 1997 → Today exceeds <strong>$7 million</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>👉 Note: Picking a truly good company and holding it for the long term can yield returns far exceeding the market and inflation.</p>

<h2>⚠️ Common Reasons for Investment Failure</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Blind Following</strong>: Chasing rising and falling prices, buying at highs.
        <ul>
            <li>Case: Bitcoin frenzy in 2017, many people entered at high prices, then halved.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Only Looking at Themes, Not Fundamentals</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Case: Among new energy concept stocks, many small companies had no profits and eventually delisted.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Excessive Use of Leverage</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Case: Chinese stock "explosion wave" in 2021, many funds were liquidated due to excessive leverage.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Short-term Speculation</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>The market is a "voting machine" in the short term and a "weighing machine" in the long term. (Graham's famous saying)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring Industry Life Cycle</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Case: Kodak was eliminated in the digital camera era.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
